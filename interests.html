            <p>My scientific background is mainly related to Mathematics. The topic of my PhD thesis was
                a particular case of the so-called Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence â€“ a very deep result,
                bridging moduli spaces arising in Algebraic and Complex Geometry to ones constructed in
                the framework of Gauge Theory by using tools of Differential Geometry. The opportunity of
                being involved in inter-disciplinary teams as well as my teaching loads raised my interest to
                practical issues, such as applications of the Mathematics in terrain and landscape modeling as
                well as to Computer Graphics and applications.
